# mysa2mqtt

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#183](https://github.com/bourquep/mysa2mqtt/pull/183)
  [`604a3b7`](https://github.com/bourquep/mysa2mqtt/commit/604a3b7df903d09f672b5fe30bacd663d1e9fe1f) Thanks
  [@vavallee](https://github.com/vavallee)! - Added `--heartbeat-file` / `M2M_HEARTBEAT_FILE`: when set, mysa2mqtt
  touches the given file on every message received from the Mysa cloud (throttled to one write per 10 seconds). External
  supervisors can watch the file's mtime to detect a wedged cloud connection and restart the process — for example a
  Kubernetes exec liveness probe checking that the file is fresher than 15 minutes.

  [@bourquep](https://github.com/bourquep)! - Moved development into the

## Releases prior to 1.2.3

This package previously lived in a standalone repository and used semantic-release, which published its release notes to
GitHub Releases rather than to a changelog file.

See the [release history](https://github.com/bourquep/mysa2mqtt/releases) for notes on versions up to and including
1.2.3. Those releases are tagged `v1.2.3`; releases from the monorepo onwards are tagged `mysa2mqtt@<version>`.
